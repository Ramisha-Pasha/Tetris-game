# Tetris Game

This project is a classic Tetris game developed in C++ as part of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course during the second semester. The game utilizes the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for graphics rendering and user input handling.

## 1. Introduction

Tetris is a classic puzzle game where players manipulate falling tetrominoes to create complete rows, which then disappear. The goal is to clear as many lines as possible and achieve a high score.

## 2. Features

- Graphics and Rendering using SFML.
- Core Tetris game mechanics: tetromino movement, rotation, and line clearing.
- Scoring system based on the number of cleared lines.
- Increasing difficulty with advancing levels.
- User interface displaying score, level, and game information.

## 3. Technologies Used

- C++ for game logic.
- SFML for graphics rendering and user input.

## 4. Project Structure

- `src/`: Source code files (e.g., `game.cpp`).
- `bin/`: Executable and compiled files.
- Header file (`tetrimino.h`).

## 5. Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Build the project using a C++ compiler.
3. Ensure SFML is properly linked.

## 6. Usage

1. Run the compiled executable.
2. Use arrow keys to move and rotate tetrominoes.
3. Clear lines to score points and advance levels.

## 7. Object-Oriented Design

The project follows an object-oriented design with classes such as Tetromino, Board, and Game. Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism are used for modular and maintainable code.

## 8. Gameplay

- Start a new game or exit from the main menu.
- Use arrow keys to control tetrominoes.
- Clear lines to score points and advance levels.
- The game speeds up as levels increase.
- Game over when the tetrominoes reach the top.
